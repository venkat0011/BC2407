## Course project

The team analysed the effectivenss of a particular telemarketing campaign. The outcome of the project was to predict if we were to cold call a particular person what was the probability that he is most likely going to accept the marketing campaign. The dataset was obtained from kaggle and it can be viewed in https://github.com/venkat0011/BC2407/blob/main/Seminar%20Group%205%20Team%202%20Project/Analytics%20Project/Seminar%20Group%205%20Team%202%20Dataset.csv

The teamn mined the data to identify trends between variables and a possible story to piece the information together. The analysis results are dispalyed in the powerBi interactive dashboard which is located at https://github.com/venkat0011/BC2407/blob/main/Seminar%20Group%205%20Team%202%20Project/Analytics%20Project/Seminar%20Group%205%20Team%202%20PowerBI.pbix

The powerbi is split into 4 segments, the first 2 is mainly showing the transformations in data to normalise their relationship and distrbutions. The nect 3 will be exploring the key results of why certain months were popular and the motivations for conversion.

The team explroed the usage of different machine learning models such as Logistic regression,MARS,CART,Random Forest and Neural Network. The effectivenss of these models are described in https://github.com/venkat0011/BC2407/blob/main/Seminar%20Group%205%20Team%202%20Project/Analytics%20Project/Seminar%20Group%205%20Team%202%20Report.docx

## Computer Based Assement

The computer based assement was to predict the resale price of HDB flats. The dataset is found in https://github.com/venkat0011/BC2407/blob/main/resale-flat-prices-201701-202103.csv. It contains the 94,373 transactions spanning from 2017 to 2021 the source code in https://github.com/venkat0011/BC2407/blob/main/Venkat_Subramanian_CBA.R The results are summarised in https://github.com/venkat0011/BC2407/blob/main/Venkat%20Subramanian_BC2407%20CBA%20Submission.pdf
